### TimeSeriesModels:

In this notebook, I reviewed a variety of time series models and applied them to real stock market data downloaded using Yahoo Finance. The models I practiced with include **Autocorrelation Function**, **Moving Average Models**, **Autoregressive Models**, **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)**, and **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** for model selection. I also explored models for volatility such as **Conditional Heteroscedasticity**, **ARCH**, and **GARCH**, as well as **Cross Correlation Function** and multivariate models like **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** and **Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA)**. These models were applied to actual financial data for hands-on experience.



### GBM-SDE:

In this Jupyter notebook, I utilized the Monte Carlo method to simulate Bitcoin data over a 2-year period using Geometric Brownian motion.

### Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process:

In this Jupyter notebook, I used the Monte Carlo method to simulate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to reproduce the intutive Wikipedia plot for 4 O-U process.

### Kramers−Moyal coefficients:

In this Jupyter notebook, we demonstrate how to find and visualize the Kramers-Moyal coefficients for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. 

### Random walk:
I learned this from Griffin Chure's Tutorial, Simulating Random Walks licensed under an MIT license.

### ARIMA-co2-dataset:
I applied ARIMA modeling to the CO2 dataset to forecast future values, following the steps outlined in the DigitalOcean tutorial on time series forecasting with ARIMA. Using the tutorial, I iteratively tested various parameter combinations to identify the model with the lowest AIC, ensuring the best fit for the data.

### Rescaled range analysis ( Hurst exponent):

The Hurst exponent (H) is a statistical metric utilized for categorizing time series. Depending on its value, a time series falls into one of three classifications. (1) H=0.5 signifies a random series. (2) 0<H<0.5 indicates an anti-persistent series. (3) 0.5<H<1 denotes a persistent series. An anti-persistent series is characterized by a tendency to "mean-revert".
