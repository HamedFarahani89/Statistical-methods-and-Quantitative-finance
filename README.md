### TimeSeriesModels:

In this notebook, I reviewed a variety of time series models and applied them to real stock market data downloaded using Yahoo Finance. The models I practiced with include \textbf{Autocorrelation Function}, \textbf{Moving Average Models}, \textbf{Autoregressive Models}, \textbf{Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)}, and \textbf{Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)} for model selection. I also explored models for volatility such as \textbf{Conditional Heteroscedasticity}, \textbf{ARCH}, and \textbf{GARCH}, as well as \textbf{Cross Correlation Function} and multivariate models like \textbf{Vector Autoregression (VAR)} and \textbf{Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA)}. These models were applied to actual financial data for hands-on experience.


### GBM-SDE:

In this Jupyter notebook, I utilized the Monte Carlo method to simulate Bitcoin data over a 2-year period using Geometric Brownian motion.

### Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process:

In this Jupyter notebook, I used the Monte Carlo method to simulate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to reproduce the intutive Wikipedia plot for 4 O-U process.

### Kramers−Moyal coefficients:

In this Jupyter notebook, we demonstrate how to find and visualize the Kramers-Moyal coefficients for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. 

### Random walk:
I learned this from Griffin Chure's Tutorial, Simulating Random Walks licensed under an MIT license.

### ARIMA-co2-dataset:
I applied ARIMA modeling to the CO2 dataset to forecast future values, following the steps outlined in the DigitalOcean tutorial on time series forecasting with ARIMA. Using the tutorial, I iteratively tested various parameter combinations to identify the model with the lowest AIC, ensuring the best fit for the data.

### Rescaled range analysis ( Hurst exponent):

The Hurst exponent (H) is a statistical metric utilized for categorizing time series. Depending on its value, a time series falls into one of three classifications. (1) H=0.5 signifies a random series. (2) 0<H<0.5 indicates an anti-persistent series. (3) 0.5<H<1 denotes a persistent series. An anti-persistent series is characterized by a tendency to "mean-revert".
